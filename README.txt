USAGE
The main program is in BatchSD.exe, so just click on it (it may take a while to load)

Functions:
Adhoc 
 - this allows you to download multiple songs by name, so feel free to just key in the name of your song!
 - Please note that the songs are downloaded from a music repository, which include music videos
	 - therefore if the song does not seem correct add a (audio) behind the name

Spotify 
 - In a spotify playlist, click the more options (...) then copy playlist url to obtain the playlist URL
 - Please note that there is currently a limit of 30 songs for the Spotify playlist import function! (could be solved in the future)
	 - if you want to download more than 30 songs pls use the .csv function 

.CSV
 - .csv is a file type which can be made using excel (comma delimited)
 - simply use our songs.csv template or make one of your own!

YouTube Playlist
 - Just copy and paste the youtube playlist URL and it will do its magic!

FAQs (or questions i imagine may be frequently asked)

What to do if the program crashes?
ANS: close the .exe file and reopen it. if it dosen't work, try harder.

Is there any concern with the large chunk of text that comes out after the Downloading complete sign comes?
ANS: Nope. The text comes from running a 3rd party program which converts videos from nasty .mp4 to nice .mp3s

Where do i find the songs?
ANS: Go to the folder labelled "mp3"

The songs are abit weird, or not the ones im looking for?
ANS: We source from a giant music repository, so you may want to narrow your search parameters.
	 - add the full name of the song
	 - add names of all artists
	 - add "audio" in the search to filter out those nasty music videos

Is there support for chinese songs?
ANS: yes. BatchSD should work for all languages. very cool.

Is this Piracy?
ANS: nawwwwwhhhhhhhh thats uber lame and BatchSD is very cool so we dont do that here.
